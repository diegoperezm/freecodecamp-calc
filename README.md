# freeCodeCamp Calc 
>  A simple calculator using a state transition table and a fsm 

This project is my solution to the [freeCodeCamp project "Build a JavaScript Calculator"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) .

The diagram is a representation of the `state machine` that controls the logic, a `state transition table` is used to describe the finite state machine.

The `state transition table`  is a string that is passed as input to two scripts (that I'am currently writing). The scripts  outputs are  an   [`edge list`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_list) (for Dagre-d3) and  a [machine config object](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/machines.html#configuration) (for [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs) ). 


## Diagram

You can: 
* Move  the diagram: click (the diagram, keep pressing) plus  mouse  movements
* Zoom in: double click (the diagram)
* Zoom out: shift plus double click (the diagram)
